# OpenGL Mandelbrot

A demo of rendering the mandelbrot set with smoothing using glsl and smoothing. I was thinking of improving it more but I've come up with a much better idea of this.

I'm not going to include a compilation and running guide since the program has no arguments, and all the dependencies are in the lib folder.
